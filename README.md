# Oldagram (Instagram Clone)

#### This Solo Project has been divided into 2 parts:
- Basic (Static HTML site, no use of JavaScript)
- Advanced (Posts are rendered using JavaScript, tried the likes incrementation stretch goal but didn't succeed.)

#### Making this project was really fun and engaging, making use of Semantic HTML and JavaScript made me understand it alot better.

#### 2 Major things I learned from this project are:
- The importance of Semantic HTML
- Dynamic Rendering using JavaScript.

  #### Links to both pages are down below:
